# Iconkiosk
This is my final project for Coderhouse ReactJS course.
It is a simple e-commerce website gradually developed throughout the course.
On this website you can browse the products and navigate to the product's detail page. there you'll find the product's description, photo and price and be able to add it to shopping cart.
You could browse the cart page to check the added products and as well as the total amount. Finally, you can checkout entering your full name, telephone number and e-mail in the form.  
You'll get the order id referencing the purchase info stored in Firebase database.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
